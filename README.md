  The brief: 
Background:

  Assume you are a Software Developer at Luxsonic Technologies. Use any and all resources that would be
  appropriate and available to you as an employee of Luxsonic technologies to complete this project. You
  may source 3D models from open sources but scripts and logic should be self-developed.
  Description and Requirements:

  You must create a 3D scene in Unity that allows a user to administer some medicine via a needle.

    • The scene should be a hospital room. It should contain a table and a patient
    • When the application starts, three items should spawn in a random order. 1) a syringe, 2) a vial
    with medicine inside and 3) a box of gloves
    • Interactions:
      1. The user must take out a glove from the glove box and drop them on their other hand to
      put them on
      2. They must pickup the syringe and attach it to the vial
      3. Then, the user should be able to take the syringe and vial apart
      4. Then, the user should be able to insert the assembled syringe into the patient’s
      arm/deltoid
    • Trying 1-4 out of order, should tell the user of their error
    • A UI with assembly results information should be presented upon completion
    o There should be a JSON record of # of attempts before successful assembly for last 3
      times the scenario is completed
    • Upon completion, the scene should reset and allow the user to restart the scenario

  Things we are looking for:
    • Collision Detection
    • Event and Unity Events
    • UI Design and Interactions
    • Audio and/or Visual Cues
    • VR Interaction Toolkit Integration
    • Parsing a JSON file

  Deliverables:
    • You must create a GitHub repository for the project and provide Luxsonic access within 2 days
    • Commit code regularly for the duration of the project
    • A final presentation (15 minutes) during which you will be asked to discuss at least one aspect of
    the project and how/why you chose to execute the way
    you did.

  Timelines:
    • You will have one to two weeks to complete this project(started March 7/ 2023). The final code commits, and an
    executable file should be made available as soon as possible.
